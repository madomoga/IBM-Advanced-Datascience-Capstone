# IBM-Advanced-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
The primary purpose of this research is to see if other companies stock prices can be used to estimate or predict price of one particular stock (JPM). The study performs dimensionality reduction on selected SP 500 companies close price data for the period 2004 to end of June 2021, and then use LTSM algorithm, a deep learning techniques to predict the close price of one big finance company, in this case JP Morgan Chase (JPM).
The project uses principal components with the JPM data, and then the original close prices of the selected big companies with JPM, to see  how the estimations differ in terms of prediction accuracy.
